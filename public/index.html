      <ol>
        <li><strong>Create or Join:</strong> The host creates a game and shares the code. Players join by entering the game code and choosing a display name.</li>
        <li><strong>Setup the Round:</strong> A random secret question is chosen from a dataset. The question will be shown to every player except the chameleon, who gets a different question.</li>
        <li><strong>Role Assignment:</strong> The game will randomly assign a certain number of chameleons.</li>
        <li><strong>Gameplay:</strong> Each player submits their answer to the question. The chameleon, not knowing they have a different question, also submits a different question.</li>
        <li><strong>Discussion & Voting:</strong> After everyone submits an answer, everyone reads their answer outloud. Then, the real question is revealed and players discuss and vote on who they think the chameleon/s is.</li>
        <li><strong>New Round or End Game:</strong> You can start a new round with the same players or end the game.</li>
