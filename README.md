# [Chameleon Questions](https://cham-questions.glitch.me)

Building on my Chameleon Online website, I adapted a new a version of Chameleon where instead of a secret word, players get a question to answer, with the chameleon answering a different question. Once the real question is revealed, players try to figure out who the chameleon is based on everybody's answers.

How to Play:

1. **Create or Join:** The host creates a game and shares the code. Players join by entering the game code and choosing a display name.
2. **Setup the Round:** A random secret question is chosen from a dataset. The question will be shown to every player except the chameleon, who gets a different question.
3. **Role Assignment:** The game will randomly assign a certain number of chameleons.
4. **Gameplay:** Each player submits their answer to the question. The chameleon, not knowing they have a different question, also submits a different question.
5. **Discussion & Voting:** After everyone submits an answer, everyone reads their answer outloud. Then, the real question is revealed and players discuss and vote on who they think the chameleon/s is.
6. **New Round or End Game:** You can start a new round with the same players or end the game.
